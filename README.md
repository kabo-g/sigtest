This is a test application designed to test a single functionality which will be implemeted on a different
application.

The developer wants to add a form field, or an html canvas to the form which will allow users
to enter thier details and sign the form with thier signatures. The canvas will capture the
mouse strokes to simulate a real signature like signing on paper is done. (with javascript - frontend)

Then the captured signature will either be converted to a javascript object notation (JSON) or an image. The result
will be submitted to the controller (View) processed and saved to the database as a form field.

The application should be able to render the populated form including with the signature as an image
or json object
